        "My name is Unathi Gcetywa and i'm 19 years of age.I am from a small town, called De Doorns now residing in Cape Town,Bellvile South. I matriculated in 2022 in HF VAN CUTSEM HIGH SCHOOL. I am an open person,i don't mind trying out things that will bring good outcomes. Since 2020 i've always had an interest on computers but unfortunately the high school i attended did not offer any computer studies. Since i've always had an interest on how to use computer,I then saw an opportunity and i registered at Life Choices Academy to be part of the Cohort 13 and learn more about Web Development In 2023,25 September,i enrolled at Life Choice Academy where i am learning how to use computers at different angles and how to use computer as a Web Developer. As i learnt more about Coding i saw that,it needs commitment and thatif one wants to perfect in,one should dedicate themselves and be willing to learn more and get knew knowledge everyday Coding is the best thing to do and is enjoyable.My goals is to become the best Web developer and create apps that will impact people in a good way."
